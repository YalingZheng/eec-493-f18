AB  - In smartphones, open ports can be exploited by malicious applications to allow attackers to remotely control user's device. In this work, we perform an attack that opens a port on an Android device to remotely connect to this port and access various phone features without requesting any permission from the user. Additionally, we develop and implement a tool called, Detecting Open Ports in Android operating system (DOPA), that detects open ports and reports them to the user.
