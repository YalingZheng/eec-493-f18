AB  - With the emergence of advanced technology, the need for improving the energy has been of paramount significance, especially in the area of wireless sensor network. The most of the energy consumed in the sensor node caused by transceiver. The efficient Medium Access Control protocol can reduce an additional energy consumption of transceiver. In this paper, we introduce an energy efficient packet scheduling (EEPS) algorithm using dynamic slot allocation (DSA). In the EEPS, head node checks empty available slots and assigns the slots those nodes that are in waiting list. Based on this algorithm, empty available slots are utilized efficiently for saving the energy consumption and improving the throughput performance. The proposed idea is implemented using network simulator (NS3) and compared with other known existing protocols.
