AB  - This paper addresses the problem of output feedback sliding mode control of sampled-data systems. Many existing control schemes can exert high gain control efforts during transients, which can be O(1/T) where T is the sampling time period. In this paper, improved versions of the previous methods are proposed so that the control effort will be O(1). The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed schemes.
