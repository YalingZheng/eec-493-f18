Abstract = {{Testing sports equipment with athletes is costly, time-consuming,
   hazardous and sometimes impracticable. We propose a method for virtual
   testing of running shoes and predict how midsoles made of BOOST affect
   energy cost of running. We contribute a visco-elastic contact model and
   identified model parameters based on load-displacement measurements. We
   propose a virtual study using optimal control simulation of
   musculoskeletal models. The predicted reduction in energy cost of for
   BOOST in comparison to conventional materials is consistent with
   experimental studies. This indicates that the proposed method is capable
   of replacing experimental studies in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Musculoskeletal modeling and simulations have become popular tools for
   analyzing human movements. However, end users are often not aware of
   underlying modeling and computational assumptions. This study
   investigates how these assumptions affect biomechanical gait analysis
   outcomes performed with Human Body Model and the OpenSim gait2392 model.
   The authors compared joint kinematics, kinetics, and muscle forces
   resulting from processing data from 7 healthy adults with both models.
   Although outcome variables had similar patterns, there were
   statistically significant differences in joint kinematics (maximal
   difference: 9.8 degrees {[}1.5 degrees] in sagittal plane hip rotation),
   kinetics (maximal difference: 0.36 {[}0.10] N.m/kg in sagittal plane hip
   moment), and muscle forces (maximal difference: 8.51 {[}1.80] N/kg for
   psoas). These differences might be explained by differences in hip and
   knee joint center locations up to 2.4 (0.5) and 1.9 (0.2) cm in the
   posteroanterior and inferosuperior directions, respectively, and by the
   offset in pelvic reference frames of about 10 degrees around the
   mediolateral axis. The choice of model may not influence the conclusions
   in clinical settings, where the focus is on interpreting deviations from
   the reference data, but it will affect the conclusions of mechanical
   analyses in which the goal is to obtain accurate estimates of kinematics
   and loading.}},

Title = {{Peak ACL force during jump landing in downhill skiing is less sensitive
   to landing height than landing position}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background Competitive skiers face a high risk of sustaining an ACL
   injury during jump landing in downhill skiing. There is a lack of
   knowledge on how landing height affects this risk.
   Objectives To evaluate the effect of varied landing height on peak ACL
   force during jump landing and to compare the effect of the landing
   height with the effect of the landing position varied by the trunk lean
   of the skier.
   Methods A 25-degree-of-freedom sagittal plane musculoskeletal model of
   an alpine skier, accompanied by a dynamic optimisation framework, was
   used to simulate jump landing manoeuvres in downhill skiing. First, a
   reference simulation was computed tracking experimental data of
   competitive downhill skier performing a jump landing manoeuvre. Second,
   sensitivity studies were performed computing 441 landing manoeuvres with
   perturbed landing height and trunk lean of the skier, and the
   corresponding effects on peak ACL force were determined.
   Results The sensitivity studies revealed that peak ACL force increased
   with jump height and backward lean of the skier as expected. However,
   peak ACL was about eight times more sensitive to the trunk lean of the
   skier compared with landing height. The decreased sensitivity of the
   landing height was based on the lower effects on the knee muscle forces
   and the shear component of the knee joint reaction force.
   Conclusion Preventive measures are suggested to focus primarily on
   avoiding trunk backward lean of the skier, and consequently on proper
   jump preparation and technique, and secondarily on strategies to reduce
   landing height during jumps.}},

Title = {{Compensation for inertial and gravity effects in a moving force platform}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{96-101}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Force plates for human movement analysis provide accurate measurements
   when mounted rigidly on an inertial reference frame. Large measurement
   errors occur, however, when the force plate is accelerated, or tilted
   relative to gravity. This prohibits the use of force plates in human
   perturbation studies with controlled surface movements, or in conditions
   where the foundation is moving or not sufficiently rigid. Here we
   present a linear model to predict the inertial and gravitational
   artifacts using accelerometer signals. The model is first calibrated
   with data collected from random movements of the unloaded system and
   then used to compensate for the errors in another trial. The method was
   tested experimentally on an instrumented force treadmill capable of
   dynamic mediolateral translation and sagittal pitch. The compensation
   was evaluated in five experimental conditions, including platform
   motions induced by actuators, by motor vibration, and by human ground
   reaction forces. In the test that included all sources of platform
   motion, the root-mean-square (RMS) errors were 39.0 N and 15.3 N m in
   force and moment, before compensation, and 1.6 N and 1.1 N m, after
   compensation. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the
   effect on estimating joint moments during human gait. Joint moment
   errors in hip, knee, and ankle were initially 53.80 N m, 32.69 N m, and
   19.10 N m, and reduced to 1.67 N m, 1.37 N m, and 1.13 N m with our
   method. It was concluded that the compensation method can reduce the
   inertial and gravitational artifacts to an acceptable level for human
   gait analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present the design of an electromechanical above-knee
   active prosthesis with energy storage and regeneration. The system
   consists of geared knee and ankle motors, parallel springs for each
   motor, an ultracapacitor, and controllable four-quadrant power
   converters. The goal is to maximize the performance of the system by
   finding optimal controls and design parameters. A model of the system
   dynamics was developed, and used to solve a combined trajectory and
   design optimization problem. The objectives of the optimization were to
   minimize tracking error relative to human joint motions, as well as
   energy use. The optimization problem was solved by the method of direct
   collocation, based on joint torque and joint angle data from ten
   subjects walking at three speeds. After optimization of controls and
   design parameters, the simulated system could operate at zero energy
   cost while still closely emulating able-bodied gait. This was achieved
   by controlled energy transfer between knee and ankle, and by controlled
   storage and release of energy throughout the gait cycle. Optimal gear
   ratios and spring parameters were similar across subjects and walking
   speeds.}},

Abstract = {{Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) employs neuroprostheses to apply
   electrical current to the nerves and muscles of individuals paralyzed by
   spinal cord injury to restore voluntary movement. Neuroprosthesis
   controllers calculate stimulation patterns to produce desired actions.
   To date, no existing controller is able to efficiently adapt its control
   strategy to the wide range of possible physiological arm
   characteristics, reaching movements, and user preferences that vary over
   time. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a control strategy that can
   incorporate human reward signals as inputs to allow human users to shape
   controller behavior. In this paper, ten neurologically intact human
   participants assigned subjective numerical rewards to train RL
   controllers, evaluating animations of goal-oriented reaching tasks
   performed using a planar musculoskeletal human arm simulation. The RL
   controller learning achieved using human trainers was compared with
   learning accomplished using human-like rewards generated by an
   algorithm; metrics included success at reaching the specified target;

Abstract = {{The linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is a classical optimal control
   approach that can regulate gait dynamics about target kinematic
   trajectories. Exoskeletons to restore gait function have conventionally
   utilized time-varying proportional-derivative (PD) control of leg
   joints. But, these PD parameters are not uniquely optimized for
   whole-body (full-state) performance. The objective of this study was to
   investigate the effectiveness of LQR full-state feedback compared to PD
   control to maintain bipedal walking of a sagittal-plane computational
   model against force disturbances. Several LQR controllers were uniquely
   solved with feedback gains optimized for different levels of tracking
   capability versus control effort. The main implications to future
   exoskeleton control systems include (1) which LQR controllers
   out-perform PD controllers in walking maintenance and effort, (2)
   verifying that LQR desirably produces joint torques that oppose rapidly
   growing joint state errors, and (3) potentially equipping accurate
   sensing systems for nonjoint states such as hip-position and torso
   orientation. The LQR controllers capable of longer walk times than
   respective PD controllers also required less control effort. During
   sudden leg collapse, LQR desirably behaved like PD by generating
   feedback torques that opposed the direction of leg-joint errors.
   Feedback from nonjoint states contributed to over 50\% of the LQR joint
   torques and appear critical for whole-body LQR control. While LQR
   control poses implementation challenges, such as more sensors for
   full-state feedback and operation near the desired trajectories, it
   offers significant performance advantages over PD control.}},

Title = {{Standardization proposal of soft tissue artefact description for data

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{5-13}},

Abstract = {{Soft tissue artefact (STA) represents one of the main obstacles for
   obtaining accurate and reliable skeletal kinematics from motion capture.
   Many studies have addressed this issue, yet there is no consensus on the
   best available bone pose estimator and the expected errors associated
   with relevant results. Furthermore, results obtained by different
   authors are difficult to compare due to the high variability and
   specificity of the phenomenon and the different metrics used to
   represent these data. Therefore, the aim of this study was twofold:
   firstly, to propose standards for description of STA; and secondly, to
   provide illustrative STA data samples for body segments in the upper and
   lower extremities and for a range of motor tasks specifically, level
   walking, stair ascent, sit-to-stand, hip- and knee-joint functional
   movements, cutting motion, running, hopping, arm elevation and
   functional upper-limb movements. The STA dataset includes motion of the
   skin markers measured in vivo and ex vivo using stereophotogrammetry as
   well as motion of the underlying bones measured using invasive or
   bio-imaging techniques (i.e., X-ray fluoroscopy or MRI). The data are
   accompanied by a detailed description of the methods used for their
   acquisition, with information given about their quality as well as
   characterization of the STA using the proposed standards. The
   availability of open-access and standard-format STA data will be useful
   for the evaluation and development of bone pose estimators thus
   contributing to the advancement of three-dimensional human movement
   analysis and its translation into the clinical practice and other
   applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with hand amputation suffer substantial loss of
   independence. Performance of sophisticated prostheses is limited by the
   ability to control them. To achieve natural and simultaneous control of
   all wrist and hand motions, we propose to use real-time biomechanical
   simulation to map between residual EMG and motions of the intact hand.
   Here we describe a musculoskeletal model of the hand using only
   extrinsic muscles to determine whether real-time performance is
   possible. Simulation is 1.3 times faster than real time, but the model
   is locally unstable. Methods are discussed to increase stability and
   make this approach suitable for prosthesis control.}},

Abstract = {{High-level spinal cord injury (SCI) in humans causes paralysis below the
   neck. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) technology applies
   electrical current to nerves and muscles to restore movement, and
   controllers for upper extremity FES neuroprostheses calculate
   stimulation patterns to produce desired arm movement. However, currently
   available FES controllers have yet to restore natural movements.
   Reinforcement learning (RL) is a reward-driven control technique; it can
   employ user-generated rewards, and human preferences can be used in
   training. To test this concept with FES, we conducted simulation
   experiments using computer-generated ``pseudohuman{''} rewards. Rewards
   with varying properties were used with an actor-critic RL controller for
   a planar two-degree-of-freedom biomechanical human arm model performing
   reaching movements. Results demonstrate that sparse, delayed
   pseudo-human rewards permit stable and effective RL controller learning.
   The frequency of reward is proportional to learning success, and
   human-scale sparse rewards permit greater learning than exclusively
   automated rewards. Diversity of training task sets did not affect
   learning. Longterm stability of trained controllers was observed. Using
   human-generated rewards to train RL controllers for upper-extremity FES
   systems may be useful. Our findings represent progress toward achieving
   human-machine teaming in control of upper-extremity FES systems for more
   natural arm movements based on human user preferences and RL algorithm
   learning capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Despite having a fully functional knee and hip in both legs, asymmetries
   in joint moments of the knee and hip are often seen in gait of persons
   with a unilateral transtibial amputation (TTA), possibly resulting in
   excessive joint loading. We hypothesize that persons with a TTA can walk
   with more symmetric joint moments at the cost of increased effort or
   abnormal kinematics. The hypothesis was tested using predictive
   simulations of gait. Open loop controls of one gait cycle were found by
   solving an optimization problem that minimizes a combination of walking
   effort and tracking error in joint angles, ground reaction force and
   gait cycle duration. A second objective was added to penalize joint
   moment asymmetry, creating a multi-objective optimization problem. A
   Pareto front was constructed by changing the weights of the objectives
   and three solutions were analyzed to study the effect of increasing
   joint moment symmetry. When the optimization placed more weight on
   moment symmetry, walking effort increased and kinematics became less
   normal, confirming the hypothesis. TTA gait improved with a moderate
   increase in joint moment symmetry. At a small cost of effort and
   abnormal kinematics, the peak hip extension moment in the intact leg was
   decreased significantly, and so was the joint contact force in the knee
   and hip. Additional symmetry required a significant increase in walking
   effort and the joint contact forces in both hips became significantly
   higher than in able-bodied gait. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper considers a conceptual design for an electromechanical rowing
   machine and its control system. The concept includes a DC motor, a gear
   transmission, a drum and a pull cable. The force-velocity characteristic
   of a commercial rowing machine was modeled by a fourth-order mechanical
   admittance, and its parameters were identified from actual exercise data
   by a collocation method. The admittance controller is related to, and an
   extension of the natural admittance control proposed by Newman. The
   controller of this paper is able to achieve any desired target
   admittance for the electromechanical system at its mechanical (user)
   port, as long as the admittance is strictly proper. A fourth-order
   mechanical admittance was identified by the collocation method, with
   very good agreement to the data. The identified admittance was
   subsequently used as the target admittance of the electromechanical
   control system. A scale-size prototype was used to test the controller
   in a real-time experiment. Achievement of the target admittance was
   verified by simulating its response to the force profile of the
   experiment. The resulting velocity was in close agreement to that
   recorded from the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes passivity-related input-output properties of a human
   muscle and tendon system given by a Hill type dynamic model. For a model
   having muscle contraction velocity as the input and force as the output,
   it is shown that the system is passive during the concentric phase.
   Also, it is shown that a negative strict passivity margin exists for the
   eccentric phase if the length and lengthening velocity of the
   contractile element are assumed bounded. Estimates of this margin are
   given by means of two alternative formulas. Further, it is shown that
   the mapping from contraction velocity to deviation from equilibrium
   force is passive in both concentric and eccentric phases. The paper
   discusses how these findings and the passivity theorem can be used to
   design controllers for a machine coupled to the muscle model by feedback
   interconnection. The simple case of a proportional derivative force
   feedback regulator is considered as an example. A simulation example is
   given where the transient response of the coupled system crosses the
   eccentric region.}},

Abstract = {{We design a control system for a prosthesis test robot that was
   previously developed for transfemoral prosthesis design and est. The
   robot's control system aims to mimic human walking In the sagittal
   plane. It has been seen in previous work that tra'ectory control alone
   fails to produce human-like forces. There `ore, we utilize an impedance
   controller to achieve reasonable,racking of motion and force
   simultaneously. However, these 9bjectives conflict. Impedance control
   design can therefore be dewed as a multi-objective optimization problem.
   We use an evolutionary multi-objective strategy called Multi-Objective
   In'asive Weed Optimization (MOIWO) to design the impedance controller.
   The multi-objective optimization problem admits a;et of equally valid
   alternative solutions known as the Pareto opimal set: We use a pseudo
   weight vector approach to select a single solution from the Pareto
   optimal set. Simulation results show that a solution that is selected
   for pure motion tracking ierforms very accurate motion tracking (RMS
   error of 0.06 cm) gut fails to produce the desired forces (RMS error of
   70\% peak `oad). On the other hand, a solution that is selected for pure
   Force tracking successfully tracks the desired force (RMS error of
   12.7\% peak load) at the expense of motion trajectory errors (RMS error
   of 4.5 cm).}},

Abstract = {{When Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is used to restore movement
   in subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI), muscle stimulation patterns
   should be selected to generate accurate and efficient movements.
   Ideally, the controller for such a neuroprosthesis will have the
   simplest architecture possible, to facilitate translation into a
   clinical setting. In this study, we used the simulated annealing
   algorithm to optimize two proportional-derivative (PD) feedback
   controller gain sets for a 3-dimensional arm model that includes
   musculoskeletal dynamics and has 5 degrees of freedom and 22 muscles,
   performing goal-oriented reaching movements. Controller gains were
   optimized by minimizing a weighted sum of position errors, orientation
   errors, and muscle activations. After optimization, gain performance was
   evaluated on the basis of accuracy and efficiency of reaching movements,
   along with three other benchmark gain sets not optimized for our system,
   on a large set of dynamic reaching movements for which the controllers
   had not been optimized, to test ability to generalize. Robustness in the
   presence of weakened muscles was also tested. The two optimized gain
   sets were found to have very similar performance to each other on all
   metrics, and to exhibit significantly better accuracy, compared with the
   three standard gain sets. All gain sets investigated used
   physiologically acceptable amounts of muscular activation. It was
   concluded that optimization can yield significant improvements in
   controller performance while still maintaining muscular efficiency, and
   that optimization should be considered as a strategy for future
   neuroprosthesis controller design. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Joint specific models rely on muscle force estimates to
   quantify tissue specific stresses. Traditionally, muscle forces have
   been estimated using inverse dynamics alone. Inverse dynamics coupled
   with static optimization techniques allow for an alternative method in
   estimating muscle forces. Differences between these two techniques have
   not been compared for determining the quadriceps force for estimating
   patellofemoral joint stress.
   Methods: Eleven female participants completed five squats and ten
   running trials. Motion capture and force platform data were processed
   using both solely inverse dynamics and inverse dynamics with static
   optimization to estimate the quadriceps force in a patellofemoral joint
   model.
   Findings: Patellofemoral joint stress calculations were consistently
   higher when using the combination of inverse dynamics and static
   optimization as compared to the inverse dynamics alone (p < 0.05)
   yielding estimates that were 30-106\% greater.
   Interpretation: When implementing joint models to estimate tissue
   specific stresses, the choice of technique used to estimate muscle
   forces plays an important role in determining the magnitude of estimated
   stresses in patellofemoral joint models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The acetabular labrum provides mechanical stability to the hip joint in
   extreme positions where the femoral head is disposed to subluxation. We
   aimed to quantify the isolated labrum's stabilizing value. Five human
   cadaveric hips were mounted to a robotic manipulator, and subluxation
   potential tests were run with and without labrum. Three-dimensional (3D)
   kinematic data were quantified using the stability index (Colbrunn et
   al., 2013, ``Impingement and Stability of Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus
   Femoral Head Resurfacing Using a Cadaveric Robotics Model,{''} J.
   Orthop. Res., 31(7), pp. 1108-1115). Global and regional stability
   indices were significantly greater with labrum intact than after total
   labrectomy for both anterior and posterior provocative positions. In
   extreme positions, the labrum imparts significant overall mechanical
   resistance to hip subluxation. Regional stability contributions vary

Abstract = {{Instrumented treadmills provide a convenient means for applying
   horizontal perturbations during gait or standing. However, varying the
   treadmill belt speed introduces inertial artifacts in the sagittal plane
   moment component of the ground reaction force. Here we present a
   compensation method based on a second-order dynamic model that predicts
   inertial pitch moment from belt acceleration. The method was tested
   experimentally on an unloaded treadmill at a slow belt speed with small
   random variations (1.20 +/- 0.10 m/s) and at a faster belt speed with
   large random variations (2.00 +/- 0.50 m/s). Inertial artifacts of up to
   12 Nm (root-mean-square, RMS) and 30 Nm (peak) were observed.
   Coefficients of the model were calibrated on one trial and then used to
   predict and compensate the pitch moment of another trial with different
   random variations. Coefficients of determination (R-2) were 72.08\% and
   96.75\% for the slow and fast conditions, respectively. After
   compensation, the root-mean-square (RMS) of the inertial artifact was
   reduced by 47.37\% for the slow speed and 81.98\% for fast speed,
   leaving only 1.5 Nm and 2.1 Nm of artifact uncorrected, respectively. It
   was concluded that the compensation technique reduced inertial errors
   substantially, thereby improving the accuracy in joint moment
   calculations on an instrumented treadmill with varying belt speed. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent advances in computational modeling and simulation of human
   movement makes it possible to isolate and predict the potential
   contributions of a prosthetic device to the overall system performance.
   The Mauch S-N-S knee is one of the most widely used prosthetic knees in
   the market. The goal of this study is to develop dynamic models of the
   Mauch S-N-S knee for predictive simulation of a transfemoral amputee's
   gait under idealized conditions. Based on the functional description of
   the Mauch S-N-S prosthetic knee from the literature, a combined bench
   test and data fitting approach employing modified slow, normal, and fast
   gait patterns and nine combinations of stance and swing damping settings
   were performed. Two types of dynamic models, 2-phase and 4-phase models,
   of the Mauch S-N-S prosthetic knee were developed. The range of the
   coefficient of determination of the two dynamic models, when compared to
   the test data, was from 39.9 to 95\%. Both dynamic models of this study
   can be utilized in musculoskeletal modeling studies, to better
   understand amputee gait and the contributions and interactions of
   various prosthetic leg components to the ambulatory performance. (C)

Abstract = {{Electrical stimulation is a promising technology for the restoration of
   arm function in paralyzed individuals. Control of the paralyzed arm
   under electrical stimulation, however, is a challenging problem that
   requires advanced controllers and command interfaces for the user. A
   real-time model describing the complex dynamics of the arm would allow
   user-in-the-loop type experiments where the command interface and
   controller could be assessed. Real-time models of the arm previously
   described have not included the ability tomodel the independently
   controlled scapula and clavicle, limiting their utility for clinical
   applications of this nature. The goal of this study therefore was to
   evaluate the performance and mechanical behavior of a real-time, dynamic
   model of the arm and shoulder girdle. The model comprises seven segments
   linked by eleven degrees of freedom and actuated by 138 muscle elements.
   Polynomials were generated to describe the muscle lines of action to
   reduce computation time, and an implicit, first-order Rosenbrock
   formulation of the equations of motion was used to increase simulation
   step-size. The model simulated flexion of the arm faster than real time,
   simulation time being 92\% of actual movement time on standard desktop
   hardware. Modeled maximum isometric torque values agreed well with
   values from the literature, showing that the model simulates the
   moment-generating behavior of a real human arm. The speed of the model
   enables experiments where the user controls the virtual arm and receives
   visual feedback in real time. The ability to optimize potential
   solutions in simulation greatly reduces the burden on the user during
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Recent data highlight that competitive skiers face a high risk of
   injuries especially during off-balance jump landing maneuvers in
   downhill skiing. The purpose of the present study was to develop a
   musculo-skeletal modeling and simulation approach to investigate the
   cause-and-effect relationship between a perturbed landing position,
   i.e., joint angles and trunk orientation, and the peak force in the
   anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) during jump landing. A two-dimensional
   musculo-skeletal model was developed and a baseline simulation was
   obtained reproducing measurement data of a reference landing movement.
   Based on the baseline simulation, a series of perturbed landing
   simulations (n=1000) was generated. Multiple linear regression was
   performed to determine a relationship between peak ACL force and the
   perturbed landing posture. Increased backward lean, hip flexion, knee
   extension, and ankle dorsiflexion as well as an asymmetric position were
   related to higher peak ACL forces during jump landing. The orientation
   of the trunk of the skier was identified as the most important predictor
   accounting for 60\% of the variance of the peak ACL force in the
   simulations. Teaching of tactical decisions and the inclusion of
   exercise regimens in ACL injury prevention programs to improve trunk
   control during landing motions in downhill skiing was concluded.}},

Title = {{Expressing the joint moments of drop jumps and sidestep cutting in

Abstract = {{Joint moments help us understand joint loading and muscle function
   during movement. However, the interpretation depends on the choice of
   reference frame, but the different reference frames have not been
   compared in dynamic, high-impact sporting movements. We have compared
   the magnitude and the resulting ranking of hip and knee joint moments
   expressed in the laboratory coordinate system, the local system of the
   distal segment and projected or decomposed to the Joint Coordinate
   System (JCS) axes. Hip and knee joint moments of drop jumps and sidestep
   cutting in 70 elite female handball players were calculated based on
   recordings from an eight-camera 240 Hz system and two force platforms
   and expressed with the four methods. The greatest variations in
   magnitude between conditions were seen for drop jump hip internal
   rotation (range: 031-0.71 Nm/kg) and sidestep cutting knee flexion
   (2.87-3.39 Nm/kg) and hip internal rotation (0.87-2.36 Nm/kg) and knee
   internal rotation (0.10-0.40 Nm/kg) moments. The rank correlations were
   highest between conditions for flexion moments (0.88-1.00) and sidestep
   cutting abduction moments (0.71-0.98). The rank correlations ranged from
   0.64 to 0.73 for drop jump knee abduction moments and between -0.17 and
   0.67 for hip and knee internal rotation moments. Expression of joint
   moments in different reference systems affects the magnitude and ranking
   of athletes. This lack of consistency may complicate the comparison and
   combination of results. Projection to the JCS is the only method where
   joint moments correspond to muscle and ligament loading. More widespread
   adoption of this convention could facilitate comparison of studies and
   ease the interpretation of results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
