The forces and velocities appearing in a prosthesis when worn by a person are simulated with a two degree-of-freedom robotic hip emulator which allows the prosthesis to walk on a treadmill. The robot produces vertical hip displacement and thigh angle motions using electromechanical actuators with direct force and torque control servos, respectively. Control inputs for the prosthetic knee are the instantaneous positions of two hydraulic valves. The integrated hip robot and prosthesis is controlled using a semiactive virtual control approach. First, a virtual controller is designed for the integrated model, assuming full control authority over the joints. Then, an online optimization problem is solved to find the valve positions that minimize the difference between the actual moment and the moment demanded by the virtual controller. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the approach.

The minimum tracking errors were 1.57% for the hip vertical hip motion, 0.29% for the thigh angle, and 0.34% for the knee angle (relative to their respective ranges of motion). The maximum steady-state control signal magnitudes were 840 N, 456 Nm, and 253 Nm for the hip vertical hip motion, thigh angle, and knee angle respectively.","D.",,"Ebeigbe",,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio 44115",,"D.",,"Simon",,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio 44115",,"H.",,"Richter",,,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio 44115",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"conference proceeding","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490530",,,"","","2016 Annual IEEE Systems Conference (SysCon)","1","6",,,,"18-21 April 2016",,

Three actuator models for the knee joint and its control method are designed, optimized, and evaluated using simulation models. The first model excludes mechanical losses. The second includes a Coulomb friction model. A more coarse efficiency model accounting for the mechanical losses is used in the third case. Energy regeneration of 11.94 J per stride resulted for the first model. The second model gave a total of 7.95 J per stride. Lastly, 1.94 J per stride were regenerated in the third model's simulation.

The DT inputs are the data gathered from phasor measurement units (PMUs). The dimensions of the training data are reduced in two ways. First, the number of features is decreased by principal component analysis (PCA). Second, the number of training cases is decreased by correlation analysis. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and invasive weed optimization (IWO) are combined with four multi-objective (MO) optimization methods to find the optimum dimensions of the PMU data while minimizing the misclassification rate of the security test. The four MO methods include vector evaluation (VE), nondominated sorting (NS), niched Pareto (NP), and strength Pareto (SP). A systematic comparison of MOIWO and MOBBO is conducted using Pareto front hypervolume and relative coverage. The method is applied to a 66-bus power grid in Iran. The results show that the training data size is reduced by about 98%, and the training time is approximately 200 times faster because of the dimension reduction. The misclassification rates of the DTs are in the range of 4â€“9%. Hypervolume and relative coverage indicate that VEBBO performs better than the other methods.","H.",,"Mohammadi",,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA",,"G.",,"Khademi",,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA",,"D.",,"Simon",,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA",,"M.",,"Dehghani",,,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Fars, Iran",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"conference proceeding","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490524",,,"","","2016 Annual IEEE Systems Conference (SysCon)","1","6",,,,"18-21 April 2016",,

The function approximation technique (FAT) is used to represent the robot's inertia matrix, the Coriolis matrix, and the gravity vector as finite linear combinations of orthonormal basis functions. The proposed controller establishes a robust FAT control framework that uses a fixed control structure. The control objectives are to track reference trajectories in worst case scenarios where the robot dynamics are too costly to develop or otherwise unavailable. Detailed stability analysis via Lyapunov functions, the passivity property, and continuous switching laws shows uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamics. The simulation results of a three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot when the robot parameters are perturbed from their nominal values show good robustness of the proposed controller when compared with some well-established control methods. We also demonstrate success in the real-time experimental implementation of the proposed controller, which validates practicality for real-world robotic applications.","D.",,"Ebeigbe",,,"Embedded Control Systems Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",,"T.",,"Nguyen",,,"Modeling Evolutionary Algorithms Simulation and Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam (e-mail: nguyentienthang@tdtu.edu.vn).",,"H.",,"Richter",,,"Controls, Robotics, and Mechatronics Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",,"D.",,"Simon",,,"Embedded Control Systems Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"journal","10.1109/TCST.2019.2914634",,,"","","IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","1","14",,,,"",,

However, gait analysis is typically performed in a gait laboratory, which is inaccessible to the general population and is not available in natural gait environments (e.g., outdoors). In this paper, we discuss the development of a high-fidelity, cost-effective, wireless sensor network to address the challenge of efficient gait monitoring in real-world walking scenarios. The sensor network is designed in a modular way to capture plantar forces and knee angle, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. A force module called a smart insole is designed to measure the plantar forces. The module is comprised of force sensitive resistors (FSRs) and a signal conditioning circuit. Various signal conditioning techniques, including a novel technique called transfrequency, are investigated to provide a linear mapping for FSR measurements and to provide data acquisition fidelity. The motion module includes a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) augmented with a Kalman filter to provide filtered knee kinematics. A qualitative evaluation of the sensor network communication module is achieved by considering the internal communication protocols between the modules and the external wireless transmission protocol used to deliver data to an end-point terminal PC. Experiments are conducted to validate the motion and force modules. Then, the overall, integrated system is compared to gold standard laboratory results, demonstrating a successful application for gait identification. The results show that the sensor network accurately captures important gait parameters and features.","M.",,"Abdelhady",,,"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA",,"A.",,"Bogert",,,"Mechanical Engineering Department, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA",,"D.",,"Simon",,,"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"journal","10.1109/JSEN.2019.2940517",,,"","","IEEE Sensors Journal","1","1",,,,"",,

Evolutionary optimization and derivative-based optimization are used to identify system parameters, and to tune a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for knee ankle tracking during swing phase. A Kalman filter is used to estimate knee angle velocity on the basis of the measured knee angle for feedback to the controller. The performance of the optimization algorithms are evaluated based on integral square error (ISE) between experiment and simulation for the system identification problem, and tracking ISE for the control problem. Results show that for system identification, particle swarm optimization (PSO) gives better results than sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO). Then PID controller optimization is performed while considering nine different shank lengths. BBO achieves the best average overall ISE, and PSO shows the fastest convergence. Finally, we see that increasing shank length results in an increase in the optimal proportional gain of the controller and a decrease in the optimal derivative and integral gains.","M.",,"Abdelhady",,,"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Dept., Cleveland State University, Ohio, USA",,"A.",,"Rashvand",,,"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Dept., Cleveland State University, Ohio, USA",,"M.",,"Moness",,,"Computers and Systems Engineering Dept., Minia University, Egypt",,"H.",,"Richter",,,"Mechanical Engineering Dept., Cleveland State University, Ohio, USA",,"D.",,"Simon",,,"Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Dept., Cleveland State University, Ohio, USA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"conference proceeding","10.23919/ACC.2017.7963060",,,"","","2017 American Control Conference (ACC)","857","862",,,,"24-26 May 2017",,

We design a robust adaptive controller so the error trajectories converge to a boundary layer and the controller shows robustness to ground reaction forces (GRFs) and parameter uncertainties. The boundary layer not only compromises between control signal chattering and tracking performance, but also stops tracking-error-based (TEB) adaptation in the boundary layer to prevent unfavorable parameter drift. We then design a tracking-error-based / prediction-error-based (TEB/PEB) adaptation law, which drives parameter adaptation using both tracking error and prediction error on the joint torques to estimate the uncertain parameters of the system. We prove the stability of the closed-loop system for the prosthesis robot model using a non-scalar boundary layer trajectory. We design the prosthesis controller to imitate the biomechanical properties of able-bodied walking and to provide smooth gait. We finally present simulation results to confirm the effectiveness of the controller for both nominal and perturbed values of the system parameters.

The semi-active joints are driven by a regenerative actuator that includes an energy-storing element. Method: External forces can have a large influence on energy regeneration characteristics. Impedance control is used to impose a desired relationship between external forces and deviation from reference trajectories. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is used to obtain optimal impedance parameters and control gains to compromise between the two conflicting objectives of trajectory tracking and energy regeneration. We solve the MOO problem under two different scenarios: 1) constant impedance; and 2) time-varying impedance. Results: The methods are applied to a transfemoral prosthesis simulation with a semi-active knee joint. Normalized hypervolume and relative coverage are used to compare Pareto fronts, and these two metrics show that time-varying impedance provides better performance than constant impedance. The solution with time-varying impedance with minimum tracking error (0.0008 rad) fails to regenerate energy (loses 9.53 J), while a solution with degradation in tracking (0.0452 rad) regenerates energy (gains 270.3 J). A tradeoff solution results in fair tracking (0.0178 rad) and fair energy regeneration (131.2 J). Conclusion: Our experimental results support the possibility of net energy regeneration at the semi-active knee joint with human-like tracking performance.

GRF estimation is a better alternative than direct GRF measurement because of the disadvantages of load cells, such as high cost, integration difficulties due to weight and physical dimensions, the possibility of overload, and measurement noise. This paper presents four robust MRAI observer/controller combinations for GRF estimation-based control of a prosthesis and a legged robot model in the presence of parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics, in which the robot model is employed to mimic able-bodied walking. Since unknown GRFs can reduce the performance of prosthesis control systems, the proposed MRAI controllers are designed to compensate their effects. All four proposed observer/controller combinations enable the system to imitate the biomechanics of able-bodied walking as defined by mechanical impedance, and provide flexible and smooth gait. Lyapunov analysis of the observer/controller combinations is used to prove stability. The four MRAI controllers are compared with each other from the perspective of GRF estimation accuracy, prosthetic knee angle tracking accuracy, parameter estimation accuracy, control effort, and computational effort. Simulation results show that all four MRAI controllers achieve good tracking performance, stable limit cycles, and accurate GRF estimation.","V.",,"Azimi",,,"School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0250 USA.",,"T.",,"Nguyen",,,"Modeling Evolutionary Algorithms Simulation and Artificial Intelligence, Faculty of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (e-mail: nguyentienthang@tdt.edu.vn).",,"M.",,"Sharifi",,,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran 11365-11155, Iran.",,"S.",,"Fakoorian",,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",,"D.",,"Simon",,,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"journal","10.1109/TSMC.2018.2836913",,,"","","IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","1","12",,,,"",,
